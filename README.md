# Behavioural modelling code

This repository contains a selection of useful functions for modelling of behaviour in learning and decision-making tasks.

All of these functions are written on top of [JAX](jax.readthedocs.io/). As a result, this code will not work on Windows unless using [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).

## Installation

To install this package, clone the repository and run `pip install .` from the root directory. It can then be used as a regular Python package, e.g. `from model_fit_tools.plotting import plot_recovery`.

To install other dependencies, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. 

## Examples

Example Jupyter notebooks can be found in the `examples` directory.
